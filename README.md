# firstflutterapp

This file contains my first flutter applications which helped me learn flutter.
You can find the main projet sources in lib folder. 
This file consists of 5 differnt projects which you can run by changing home property of materialApp in runApp of main.dart.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

to run a flutter application you have to install android studio and flutter plugins. then you should provide a simulator (use in-app simulators or your own device). then click on run (available in android studio) and see the application on your simulator.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
